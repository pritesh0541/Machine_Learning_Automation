# Machine_Learning_Automation

Thid id my project Machine learning also using git hub and jenkins and also docker container approch


MLOps is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage production ML lifecycle.

we , humens try to make our woking easy thats why we learnt that how to make our machine able to learn and  show some results on the basis of data set.

Here , we are integrating ML with git (devops) to continuous devployment and working.


Here is one Project based on this MlOps problem, and I have taken Mnist dataset. and tried to automate its training and get some more accuracy.


Object:- when we learn our machine then , model will automatically predict and show higher accuracy.

Task description
1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Python3 and Keras or numpy installed using dockerfile. 

2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts train the model in the container.

3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3, job4 and job5 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins .

4. Job1 : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

5. Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective machine learning software installed interpreter install image container to deploy code and start training( eg. If code uses CNN, then Jenkins should start the container that has already installed all the softwares required for the cnn processing).

6. Job3 : Train your model and predict accuracy or metrics.

7. Job4 : if metrics accuracy is less than 80% , then tweak the machine learning model architecture.

8. Job5: Retrain the model or notify that the best model is being created

9. Create One extra job job6 for monitor : If container where app is running. fails due to any reason then this job should automatically start the container again from where the last trained model left.
